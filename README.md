# mdb-cs-ubuntu-1604
## Overview

This project builds uses the WonkyWumpus/easy-sshd-ubuntu-1604 project as a starting point for building a MariaDB AX (MariaDB Columnstore) cluster running on Kubernetes.  It includes a Dockerfile that takes the networking and sshd capabilities built into the easy-sshd project and then adds OS prerequisites and stages the MariaDB AX tarfile into the images.  It also includes yaml files for creating the containers and the service that will be used to run the cluster.
